###HOW TO USE GITHUB
Github is a fancy online implementation of a system called git. Git is known as a 'version control'
system. Simply:

1. Github holds a folder containing the entire project.
2. You tell git to sync the project to your computer, it copies it over.
3. You change one of the files.
4. You tell git to sync your changes to the master copy (the copy on Github).
5. Git looks through your folder, and notices that you've only changed one file. Specifically, it even looks through the file, and realises the specific lines you've changed.
6. Git uploads just the changes you made to the master copy on Github.
	
Github remembers every single change anybody has ever made. It does fancy things like show you
timelines of changes, and lets you roll back at any time. It's pretty easy to pick up.
